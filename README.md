## Description

The goal of palmerpenguins is to provide a great dataset for data exploration & visualization, as an alternative to iris.

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

Please see [https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) for more information.

## Citation
Anyone interested in publishing the data should contact [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) about analysis and working together on any final products. From Gorman et al. (2014): _"Individuals interested in using these data are expected to follow the US LTER Network’s Data Access Policy, Requirements and Use Agreement: https://lternet.edu/data-access-policy/."_

This dataset has been derived from the R package palmerpenguins available from [https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

#### Bill dimensions

The culmen is the upper ridge of a bird’s bill. In this simplified dataset, culmen length and depth are renamed as variables bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm to be more intuitive.

For this penguin data, the culmen (bill) length and depth are measured as shown below (thanks Kristen Gorman for clarifying!):
